                <!-- <p>Hi, my name is Krishnakripa Jayakumar, though, you can call me Kripa for short. I'm an educator üë©‚Äçüè´
                    based in Colombo, Sri Lanka. I teach students how to use code to solve problems of their own üë©‚Äçüíª.
                    There are two things I like. Learning üìñ and teaching.
                <p> Learning is easy, but teaching is a huge responsibility and I take my responsibilities very
                    seriously.
                </p> -->
                <p> I have a student my whole life. In 2020, I woke up one day and realized I wanted to learn more and
                    become a professional in the Cyber Security field, so I enrolled for an MSc. Two years later, after
                    completing I discovered that I was very passionate about digital forensics and one day hope to call
                    myself a digital forensic investigator. I am open for oppurtunities if you are hiring. I learn fast,
                    I adapt even faster</p>

                                as manipulations of
                                videos
                                that threaten to violate the privacy and
                                identity of a person by hijacking their face and swapping it onto the body of another
                                person (face-swapping) has seen a dramatic rise over the recent years. The ‚ÄúDeepfakes‚Äù
                                of today, as they are known, have become very convincing that they are indistinguishable
                                from authentic videos. Though promising headway has been made in field of deepfake
                                detection, existing research mostly focus only on classifying a video in binary forms-
                                either as a deepfake or not, without any explanations as to why the model classified it
                                as such. However, these works fail in situations where explainability and transparency
                                behind a tool‚Äôs decision is crucial, especially in a court of law, where the Court may
                                demand justifications and explanations for why a video is a deepfake from a digital
                                forensic expert. Explainable AI (XAI) has the potential to give a whole new meaning to
                                deepfake detection, hence a new research area called Explainable Deepfake detection
                                comes into the picture that help explain decisions behind a black-box system‚Äôs
                                predictions, easily to humans. This is however a new yet niche area with limited
                                contribution, therefore, based on the limitations identified in the existing XDD works,
                                this research proposes the use of an XAI method called Anchors, a model-agnostic high
                                precision explainer, that can explain the reasons behind the predictions of a custom
                                made Deepfake detector. This work is also one of the first to approach the problem from
                                a digital forensic viewpoint, enabling the development of a digital forensic toolkit for
                                deepfake detection. The approach, design, implementation, and evaluation steps are

                                Analysis of hotels</li>

                                public‚Äôs opinions about the services offered by the hotel industry such as food, room
                                and service, can be found most evidently in open ended, user generated online hotel
                                reviews. Though sentiment can be identified for aspects, using aspect based Sentiment
                                analysis, one main challenge is the limitation of only using linguistic factors to
                                determine sentiment.
                                Through an in-depth literature study and industry survey, latent factors which affect
                                sentiment of travel reviews were identified and three Fuzzy Inference Systems (cascaded)
                                were developed to devise accurate sentiment for the hotel aspects. The three systems
                                calculates how much trust a review(er) should be allocated, the weightages /importance
                                for each aspect mentioned in the review and finally the sentiment scores of each aspect.
                                Drogo is the first of its kind and is hence conveniently named human reasoning based
                                sentiment analysis.
                                System accuracy was tested based on the rules while accuracy was also tested based on
                                the values output by Drogo. The usage of Fuzzy logic makes Drogo perform well, produces
                                acceptable results and is hence justified.
